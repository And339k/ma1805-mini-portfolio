For the drawing project at first I created smiple objects like circles and other things etc however I shifted to more complex objects in order to possibly challenge myself a bit more if that makes sense. However I feel that I'm not totally getting the hang of this coding stuff and maybe it is somethinmg that i need to figure out and flesh out a little bit more as I seem or at least feel a little behind or worse then the rest of my peers/classmates, which makes sense Perhaps I should aim to actively and thoroughly engage with the project far more so that I'm more compentent and effective at using VsCode.
The drawing project I believe the colours are alright however it probably seems rather simple and less dynamic then others I just used the moodle as the template in order to engaged. I don't know if It that would affect my marks or not.
