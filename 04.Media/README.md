I actually seemed to struggle with this one a decently quite a bit cause I dont know if It's gotten better but as I was working on the project the project kept having loading issues and display issues I dont know if it's an issue with me background or media or something That I perhaps did wrong or incorrect at all but yeah. I'm still trying to get batter and improve on the work so hopefully when u see this then it will be all better and all issues will be resolved and that in the mean time. 
I also tried or attempted to experiment with sound and sound incorporation that into it remembering the previous lecture on the last week of october and add this to my code, However if your reading this I dont know how or if this turned out  rlly effective if at all I'll just have to see However I tried my best to get over my lack of efficent coding and developing skills at the time.
